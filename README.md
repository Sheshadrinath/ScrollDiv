# ScrollDiv
Demonstrating scrolling capabilities without scrollbar

If we have a requirement to scroll a div container horizontally without using the scrollbar, then this is the apt one. The script is going to
detect the div content overflow and will automatically add the left scroll and right scroll buttons on either side of the main div
container. User can click on these buttons to scroll right or left.

Please go through the names and id's of the elements. You may have to modify the class names and attributes to suit your requirement. Like you might have change the width or any style related iformation.
